**What CRISPR Does**
**Gene Editing:** CRISPR allows scientists to precisely cut and modify DNA at specific locations in the genome. It acts like molecular scissors that can target and alter genetic material.

**Guide RNA:** A short piece of RNA is designed to match a specific DNA sequence in the genome. This guide RNA directs the CRISPR system to the exact location where editing is needed.

**Cutting and Repairing:** Once CRISPR is guided to the target DNA, it cuts the DNA at that spot. The cell's natural repair mechanisms then fix the break, allowing scientists to add, delete, or change genetic material.\n



**Why CRISPR Is Done**
**Disease Treatment:** CRISPR can potentially correct genetic defects that cause diseases, offering new ways to treat conditions like cystic fibrosis, sickle cell anemia, and some types of cancer.

**Research:** It helps scientists understand the role of specific genes by allowing them to edit or disable these genes and observe the effects.

**Agriculture:** CRISPR is used to create crops that are more resistant to diseases, pests, and environmental conditions, leading to more sustainable farming.
**
Biotechnology:** It can be used to engineer organisms to produce useful substances, like pharmaceuticals or biofuels.
